# Hi, I'm Budi 👋

### **Aspiring Web Developer | Finance & Operations Background | Multilingual Problem-Solver**

🌱 I’m transitioning into **tech**, building on my experience in **finance operations**, **risk management**, and **process optimization** with a growing skillset in **web development**.

💻 My path spans finance, operations, and technology — combining analytical problem-solving with cultural adaptability and a calm, focused approach under pressure. I’ve worked in fast-paced, high-volume environments where accuracy and reliability were critical, and I now apply the same discipline to coding projects.

🌍 Having studied and worked across **Indonesia**, **China**, and the **Philippines**, I bring cross-cultural awareness and strong communication skills. Fluent in **Mandarin**, **English**, and **Indonesian**, I enjoy bridging gaps between people, systems, and ideas.

💡 Guided by the belief that **“with persistence and adaptability, any problem can be solved and any skill can be mastered,”** I aim to contribute to meaningful, tech-driven solutions that make a real impact.
