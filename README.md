# Hi, I'm Budi 👋

### **Operations & Finance Professional Transitioning to Fintech-Driven Solutions | Aspiring Fintech Developer | Finance & Risk Management | Multilingual Problem-Solver**

🌱 I’m transitioning into **tech**, building on my experience in **high volume financial systems**, **risk analysis**, and **process optimization** with a growing skillset in **web and software development**. I aim to combine my financial background with technical skill to create tools that improve accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration.

💻 My career has taken me through finance, operations, and technology, where I learned to value precision, teamwork, and quiet determination. In high-volume financial environments, I developed the ability to stay calm under pressure, detect small patterns in large systems, and deliver dependable results.

🌍 Having lived and worked in **Indonesia**, **China**, and the **Philippines**, I’ve learned that respect, communication, and adaptability are the foundations of meaningful teamwork. I’m fluent in **Mandarin**, **English**, and **Indonesian**, and I continue to study **Japanese** to deepen my understanding of the culture and values that inspire me.

💡 Guided by the belief that **“with persistence and adaptability, any problem can be solved and any skill can be mastered,”** I aim to contribute to meaningful, tech-driven solutions that make a real impact.
